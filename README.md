#Knowledge Plaza Front-End Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to learn, to have fun and to test if you would have fun working at Knowledge Plaza. If you apply for a Junior position, the code you will write is a lot less important than the way you approach an unknown problem.

##Description of the challenge

You are asked to write a small web application that display a dynamic stream of "tiles". Each tile may have tags. The stream should be filtrable by tags and/or by plain search.

Your application will also allow your user to create a tile.

The initial content is described as a list of tiles in the attached JSON file. Each tile has multiple properties but you may only consider using tile.title and tile.tags. Other are optionnal but we are eager to see your creativity!

We expect the code to be readable and to have tests.
