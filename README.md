#Knowledge Plaza Front-End Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to learn, to have fun and to test if you would have fun working at Knowledge Plaza. If you apply for a Junior position, the code you will write is a lot less important than the way you approach an unknown problem.

##Description of the challenge

You are asked to write a small web application that display a dynamic stream of "tiles". Each tile is an exerpt of a piece of content. Tiles may have tags. 

The stream should be filtrable by tags and/or by plain search. Your application will also allow your user to create a tile that will be displayed imediately in the stream.

The initial content is described as a list of tiles in the attached JSON file. Each tile has multiple properties but you may only consider using tile.title and tile.tags. Other are optionnal but we are eager to see your creativity!

In the example above, each tile is a rectangle. The color is determined by tile.subtype, then tile.title, tile.description and tile.tags are displayed.

The right column allows to filter content in the first box. The second box allows to create a tile with a title and tags but no description.

##Technical specifications

We are asking you to create a private (or somewhat secret) github repository with your code. We strongly recommend the use of an existing framework surch as AngularJS or React.

We expect the code to be readable and to have tests.

In order to see how you work, we are interested by seeing each commits. A big dump of your project to github in one commit is not a good idea.
